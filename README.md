## Battenberg R code

The Battenberg R code is maintained in a separate repository [Wedge-Oxford/battenberg][bb-repo]
and this is where any questions or issues specific to the R code should be directed.

### Scientific notation in R

To prevent scientifi notation being used for genome coordinates, rlease ensure that your `~/.Rprofile` contains the following line:

```R
options(scipen = 999)
```

## Docker, Singularity and Dockstore

There is a pre-built image containing this codebase on quay.io.

* [dockstore-cgpwgs][ds-cgpwgs-git]: Contains additional tools for WGS analysis.

This was primarily designed for use with dockstore.org but can be used as normal containers.

The docker images are know to work correctly after import into a singularity image.

## Installation

The battenberg R files are installed automatically from the Battenberg GitHub repository found
[here][bb-repo]. The linked version is currently [`v2.2.5`][bb-ver-link].

Please install the following first:

1. [PCAP-core v2.1.3+][pcap-core-rel]
2. [alleleCount v3.3.1+][allele-count-rel]
3. [cgpVcf v2.0.1+][cgpvcf-rel]

Then execute:

```
setup.sh <install_to_folder> [X/lib/perl:Y/lib/perl]
cd Rsupport
./setupR.sh <install_to_folder>/R-libs
```

All of the items listed here use the same install method.

### Prerequisites

* Impute2 executables can be found [here][impute-exe]
  * Any impute related data for download
* BWA Mapped, indexed, duplicate marked/removed bam files, for both a matched normal and tumour sample
* Reference.fasta and index
* A file containing a list of contigs in the reference .fai to ignore

Some required data files are not included in the distribution but a script is included to generate these for you:

* Directory containing the 1000 genomes allele and loci data:
  * Generated using the included script ``download_generate_bberg_ref_files.pl``
* Impute info file ``impute_info.txt``
  * Generated using the included script ``download_generate_bberg_ref_files.pl``
* Prob loci file probloci.txt
  * Included: ``files/probloci.txt.gz``

Additionally, the wgs_gc_correction_1000g files need to be downloaded. These can be obtained from the Battenberg R code site [here][bb-ref].
  * The chr X wgs_gc_correction_1000g will require renaming. `mv 1000_genomes_GC_corr_chr_23.txt.gz 1000_genomes_GC_corr_chr_X.txt.gz`

## Program Run Instructions

For the most up to date usage instructions for the wrapper code please see the command line help:

`battenberg.pl -h`

Please check the [wiki][cgpbb-wiki] for common problems before raising any issues.
